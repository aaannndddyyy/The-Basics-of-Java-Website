                <center><p>Java programming language was originally developed by Sun
                Microsystems which was initiated by James Gosling and released
                in 1995 as core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform
                (Java 1.0 [J2SE]). As of December 2008, the latest release of
                the Java Standard Edition is 6 (J2SE). With the advancement of
                Java and its widespread popularity, multiple configurations
                were built to suite various types of platforms. Ex: J2EE for
                Enterprise Applications, J2ME for Mobile Applications. Sun
                Microsystems has renamed the new J2 versions as Java SE, Java
                EE and Java ME respectively. Java is guaranteed to be Write
                Once, Run Anywhere.</p></center>


                <h4 style="text-decoration: underline">Java is:</h4>


                <ul>
                    <li><b>Object Oriented:</b> In Java, everything is an
                    Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on
                    the Object model.</li>


                    <li><b>Platform independent:</b> Unlike many other
                    programming languages including C and C++, when Java is
                    compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific
                    machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This
                    byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by
                    virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being
                    run.</li>


                    <li><b>Simple:</b> Java is designed to be easy to learn. If
                    you understand the basic concept of OOP Java would be easy
                    to master.</li>


                    <li><b>Secure:</b> With Java's secure feature it enables to
                    develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication
                    techniques are based on public-key encryption.</li>


                    <li><b>Architectural-neutral:</b> Java compiler generates
                    an architecture-neutral object file format which makes the
                    compiled code to be executable on many processors, with the
                    presence of Java runtime system.</li>


                    <li><b>Portable:</b> Being architectural-neutral and having
                    no implementation dependent aspects of the specification
                    makes Java portable. Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C
                    with a clean portability boundary which is a POSIX
                    subset.</li>


                    <li><b>Robust:</b> Java makes an effort to eliminate error
                    prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time
                    error checking and runtime checking.</li>


                    <li><b>Multithreaded:</b> With Java's multithreaded feature
                    it is possible to write programs that can do many tasks
                    simultaneously. This design feature allows developers to
                    construct smoothly running interactive applications.</li>


                    <li><b>Interpreted:</b> Java byte code is translated on the
                    fly to native machine instructions and is not stored
                    anywhere. The development process is more rapid and
                    analytical since the linking is an incremental and light
                    weight process.</li>


                    <li><b>High Performance:</b> With the use of Just-In-Time
                    compilers, Java enables high performance.</li>


                    <li><b>Distributed:</b> Java is designed for the
                    distributed environment of the internet.</li>


                    <li><b>Dynamic:</b> Java is considered to be more dynamic
                    than C or C++ since it is designed to adapt to an evolving
                    environment. Java programs can carry extensive amount of
                    run-time information that can be used to verify and resolve
                    accesses to objects on run-time.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>History of Java:</h2>


                <p>James Gosling initiated the Java language project in June
                1991 for use in one of his many set-top box projects. The
                language, initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood
                outside Gosling's office, also went by the name Green and ended
                up later being renamed as Java, from a list of random words.
                Sun released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in
                1995. It promised Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA), providing
                no-cost run-times on popular platforms. On 13 November 2006,
                Sun released much of Java as free and open source software
                under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). On 8
                May 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of Java's core
                code free and open-source, aside from a small portion of code
                to which Sun did not hold the copyright.</p>
