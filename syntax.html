                <h1>The Syntax</h1>


                <p>The Definition: The syntax of the Java programming language
                is the set of rules defining how a Java program is written and
                interpreted. The syntax is mostly derived from C and C++.
                Unlike C++, Java is almost exclusively an object-oriented
                language. There are no global functions or variables, all code
                belongs to classes and all values are objects. The only
                exception is the primitive types, which are not represented by
                a class instance due to performance reasons (though can be
                automatically converted to objects and vice-versa via
                autoboxing). Some features like operator overloading or
                unsigned integer types are omitted to simplify the language and
                to avoid possible programming mistakes. Java syntax is
                constantly improved in major JDK releases. The latest
                improvements to the language happened in Java SE 7, which
                introduced such language features as try-with-resources
                statements and binary literals.</p>


                <h3>When we consider a Java program it can be defined as a
                collection of objects that communicate via invoking each
                other's methods. Let us now briefly look into what do class,
                object, methods and instance variables mean. There are Objects,
                Classes, Methods and Instance Variables...</h3>


                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Object - Objects have states and behaviors. Example:
                        A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as
                        behaviors -wagging, barking, eating. An object is an
                        instance of a class.</p>
                    </li>


                    <li>
                        <p>Class - A class can be defined as a template/ blue
                        print that describes the behaviors/states that object
                        of its type support.</p>
                    </li>


                    <li>
                        <p>Methods - A method is basically a behavior. A class
                        can contain many methods. It is in methods where the
                        logics are written, data is manipulated and all the
                        actions are executed.</p>
                    </li>


                    <li>
                        <p>Instance Variables - Each object has its unique set
                        of instance variables. An object's state is created by
                        the values assigned to these instance variables.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>


                <h3>First Java Program:</h3>


                <p>Let us look at a simple code that would print the words
                Hello World:</p>


                <p>
                </p>


                <div style=
                "height:300px;width:1800px;border:9px inset #00BFFF; #ccc; overflow-y:scroll;overflow-x:scroll; background-color:#CFCFCF;">
                <pre>
<code>public class MyFirstJavaProgram {

   /* This is my first java program.  
    * This will print 'Hello World' as the output
    */

    public static void main(String []args) {
       System.out.println("Hello World"); // prints Hello World
    }
} 
                </code>
</pre>
                </div>
                <br>


                <h3>Basic Syntax:</h3>


                <p>About Java programs, it is very important to keep in mind
                the following points. <b>Case Sensitivity</b> - Java is case
                sensitive, which means identifier Hello and hello would have
                different meaning in Java. <b>Class Names</b> - For all class
                names the first letter should be in Upper Case. If several
                words are used to form a name of the class, each inner word's
                first letter should be in Upper Case. Example <code>class:
                MyFirstJavaClass.</code> <b>Method Names</b> - All method names
                should start with a Lower Case letter. If several words are
                used to form the name of the method, then each inner word's
                first letter should be in Upper Case. Example <code>public void
                myMethodName()</code>. <b>Program File Name</b> - Name of the
                program file should exactly match the class name. When saving
                the file, you should save it using the class name (Remember
                Java is case sensitive) and append '.java' to the end of the
                name (if the file name and the class name do not match your
                program will not compile). Example : Assume
                <code>MyFirstJavaProgram</code> is the class name. Then the
                file should be saved as <code>MyFirstJavaProgram.java</code>.
                The main class: <code>public static void main(String
                args[])</code> - Java program processing starts from the
                <code>main()</code> method which is a mandatory part of every
                Java program..</p>


                <h3>Java Identifiers:</h3>


                <p>All Java components require names. Names used for classes,
                variables and methods are called identifiers. In Java, there
                are several points to remember about identifiers. They are as
                follows:<br>
                All identifiers should begin with a letter (A to Z or a to z),
                currency character ($) or an underscore (_). After the first
                character identifiers can have any combination of characters. A
                key word cannot be used as an identifier. Most importantly
                identifiers are case sensitive. Examples of legal identifiers:
                <code>age</code>, <code>$salary</code>, <code>_value</code>,
                <code>__1_value</code>. Examples of illegal identifiers:
                <code style="color:#DF0101">123abc</code>, <code style=
                "color:#DF0101">-salary</code>.</p>
		
		<form id="frm1" action="form_action.asp">
		<p>Is the variable name<code>Example1_123_abs_ACS</code> legal in Java? [<code>y</code>/<code>n</code>]: <input type="text" name="q1"> 
		<input type="button" onclick="myFunction()" value="Submit"><br>
		Is the variable <code>123example2_Hi</code> legal in Java? [<code>y</code>/<code>n</code>]: <input type="text" name="q2">
		<input type="button" onclick="myFunction2()" value="Submit"><br>
		</p>
		
		</form>
		
		<script>
		function myFunction() {
			var q1 = document.forms["frm1"]["q1"].value;
			if (q1 == "y") {		
				alert("Correct!");
			}
			else if(q1 == "n"){
				alert("Incorrect.");
			}
			else {
				alert("Usage: y or n.");
			}
		}
		function myFunction2() {
			var q2 = document.forms["frm1"]["q2"].value;
			if (q2 == "n") {		
				alert("Correct!");
			}
			else if(q2 == "y"){
				alert("Incorrect.");
			}
			else {
				alert("Usage: y or n.");
			}
		}		
		</script>
			
		
                <h3>Java Modifiers:</h3>


                <p>Like other languages, it is possible to modify classes,
                methods, etc., by using modifiers. There are two categories of
                modifiers: Access Modifiers: <code>default</code>,
                <code>public</code> , <code>protected</code>,
                <code>private</code> Non-access Modifiers: <code>final</code>,
                <code>abstract</code>, <code>strictfp</code></p>


                <h3>Java Variables:</h3>


                <p>We would see following type of variables in Java: Local
                Variables Class Variables (Static Variables) Instance Variables
                (Non-static variables)</p>


                <h3>Java Arrays:</h3>


                <p>Arrays are objects that store multiple variables of the same
                type. However, an array itself is an object on the heap.</p>


                <h3>Java Enums:</h3>


                <p>Enums were introduced in java 5.0. Enums restrict a variable
                to have one of only a few predefined values. The values in this
                enumerated list are called enums. With the use of enums it is
                possible to reduce the number of bugs in your code. For
                example, if we consider an application for a fresh juice shop,
                it would be possible to restrict the glass size to small,
                medium and large. This would make sure that it would not allow
                anyone to order any size other than the small, medium or
                large.</p>


                <div style=
                "height:300px;width:1800px;border:9px inset #00BFFF; #ccc; overflow-y:scroll;overflow-x:scroll; background-color:#CFCFCF;">
                <pre>
<code>class FreshJuice {

   enum FreshJuiceSize{ SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE }
   FreshJuiceSize size;
}

public class FreshJuiceTest {

   public static void main(String args[]){
      FreshJuice juice = new FreshJuice();
      juice.size = FreshJuice. FreshJuiceSize.MEDIUM ;
      System.out.println("Size: " + juice.size);
   }
}
                </code>
</pre>
                </div>


                <p>The above code will produce the following result:<br>
                <code>Size: MEDIUM</code><br>
                <b>Note:</b> enums can be declared as their own or inside a
                class. Methods, variables, constructors can be defined inside
                enums as well.</p>
                <br>
                <br>


                <h3>Java Keywords:</h3>


                <p>The following list shows the reserved words in Java. These
                reserved words may not be used as constant or variable or any
                other identifier names.</p>


                <center><table>

                <h3>Comments in Java:</h3>


                <p>Java supports single-line and multi-line comments very
                similar to c and c++. All characters available inside any
                comment are ignored by Java compiler.</p>


                <div style=
                "height:300px;width:1800px;border:9px inset #00BFFF; #ccc; overflow-y:scroll;overflow-x:scroll; background-color:#CFCFCF;">
                <pre>
<code>public class MyFirstJavaProgram{

   /* This is my first java program.
    * This will print 'Hello World' as the output
    * This is an example of multi-line comments.
    */

    public static void main(String []args){
       // This is an example of single line comment
       /* This is also an example of single line comment. */
       System.out.println("Hello World"); 
    }
} 
                </code>
</pre>
                </div>

<br>
                <h3>Using Blanks Lines:</h3>


                <p>A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment,
                is known as a blank line, and Java totally ignores it.</p>


                <h3>Inheritance:</h3>


                <p>In Java, classes can be derived from classes. Basically if
                you need to create a new class and here is already a class that
                has some of the code you require, then it is possible to derive
                your new class from the already existing code. This concept
                allows you to reuse the fields and methods of the existing
                class without having to rewrite the code in a new class. In
                this scenario the existing class is called the superclass and
                the derived class is called the subclass.</p>


                <h3>Interfaces:</h3>


                <p>In Java language, an interface can be defined as a contract
                between objects on how to communicate with each other.
                Interfaces play a vital role when it comes to the concept of
                inheritance. An interface defines the methods, a deriving
                class(subclass) should use. But the implementation of the
